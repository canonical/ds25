# DS-25 - Canonical's New Design System

Welcome to DS-25 (name subject to change), Canonical's next-generation design system. 
This monorepo serves as the central hub for our efforts to
create a cohesive, efficient, and accessible design system and related tooling.

## 1. Our Core Values

DS-25 is built upon the following core values:

* **Reduced Complexity:** We strive for simplicity and clarity in our design and code, making it simple for everyone to
  use and contribute.
* **Fast and Modern Tooling:** We leverage cutting-edge, forward-looking technologies and workflows to ensure a smooth
  and efficient development experience.
* **Accessibility:** We prioritize inclusivity by designing for accessibility from the ground up, ensuring our products
  are usable by everyone.
* **Performance:** We emphasize speed and efficiency, optimizing our design system for optimal performance in production
  and development environments.

## 2. Project Goals

DS-25 aims to provide a comprehensive design system that empowers teams to build consistent, high-quality user
experiences. We are focused on:

* Creating a robust and scalable foundation for Canonical's design language.
* Providing a seamless developer experience with modern tooling and clear documentation.
* Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for all users.
* Establishing a collaborative environment for design and development.
