## React Vite Boilerplate

This project provides a template that can be used to quickly create a React Vite
application using the standard set of shared Canonical packages.

#### Running the boilerplate

Run `bun run dev` to run a live development server with HMR.

Run `bun run serve` to run a server-side rendered version of the app using the [React SSR](../../../packages/react/ssr) package.
