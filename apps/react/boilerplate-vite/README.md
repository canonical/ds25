## React Vite Boilerplate

This project provides a template that can be used to quickly create a React Vite
application using the standard set of shared Canonical packages.

#### Running the boilerplate

Run `bun run dev` to run a live development server with HMR.

Run `bun run serve` to run a server-side rendered version of the app using the [React SSR](../../../packages/react/ssr) package.

##### Build/Serve commands

Two mechanisms for building/serving the application are supported:
- CLI-based: Invoke `@canonical/react-ssr`'s `serve-express` bin script to create an express server.
- Middleware-based: Call `@canonical/react-ssr`'s `serveStream()` function to create a middleware that can be used with an existing express server.

In both cases, the client is built the same way (`bun run build:client`).
The server is built differently depending on the approach:
- CLI-based: The server's SSR renderer module is the entry point. Built with `bun run build:server:cli`, served with `bun run serve:cli`.
- Middleware-based: The server's server script is the entry point. Built with `bun run build:server:middleware`, served with `bun run serve:middleware`.

The current default behavior is to use the middleware-based approach. 
So, `bun run build:server` and `bun run serve` will use the middleware scripts.

In the future, it is intended that the CLI-based approach will be the default, 
and the existing `server.ts` file will be moved to the SSR package as an example.
