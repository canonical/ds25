## React Vite Boilerplate

This project provides a template that can be used to quickly create a React Vite
application using the standard set of shared Canonical packages.

### Getting started
#### Installing the boilerplate
An installer script is provided that automatically checks out and configures the boilerplate.

`npx @canonical/boilerplate-react-vite setup`

Then, install node dependencies using your package manager's `install` command. 

##### Testing the installer script
If you are working on this boilerplate itself and need to test it, you can run it locally:

```bash
cd apps
npx ./boilerplate-react-vite setup
```

#### Running the boilerplate
Run `bun run dev` to run a live development server.
