## React Component Generator

This generator creates a new React component with a basic structure.

### Getting Started
1. Install [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/): `bun add -g yo`
2. Run the generator: `yo @canonical/canonical-ds:component path/to/component`

The following optional flags can be used:
- `--withStyles`: Include a CSS file for the component.
- `--withStories`: Include a Storybook file for the component.
