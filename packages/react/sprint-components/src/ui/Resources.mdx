## Component Workshop Resources

Create a new component within our architecture!
For a step-by-step guide on creating a new component, please see the [create a React component tutorial](https://github.com/canonical/ds25/blob/6e8fb2bdbff891e14d35dca60e436bbc09a3a34e/docs/how-to-guides/CREATE_A_REACT_COMPONENT.md).

### Your Task

Create a new React Component inside this package. This will give you exposure to the architecture and ways of working.

You will have about 35 minutes to develop your component, so you should keep the component relatively simple.

If you need some inspiration, here are some ideas:
- Live character counter - A textarea with some max character count that displays the number of remaining characters left, and
  changes color when the limit is reached.
- Password visibility toggle - A password field that changes the visibility of the password when a button is clicked.
- Progress bar - a simple progress bar that can display linear progress.
- User profile card - a card that displays key user information, such as a name, e-mail address, and profile picture.
- Accordion - an accordion that can expand and collapse to show or hide content.

We recommend you to push your changes to this remote (upstream) as a new branch `sprint/YourComponentName` so that your component can be displayed
if you would like it to be shown during the discussions.

### Capturing your thoughts

We aim to capture your thoughts and ideas on your experience with our patterns and processes in [this Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVI2ERLF4=/?share_link_id=979639863283).
You will have dedicated time to add your thoughts after the development time, but you may also add them as you go along.
