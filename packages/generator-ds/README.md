# Canonical Generator

## Getting Started

1. Install [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and this generator: `npm i -g yo @canonical/generator-ds`
2. Run the generator: `yo @canonical/ds`



### Available Generators
Generators are available for the following resources:
- [React Component](./src/component/README.md). 

## Caveats

+ the package `@yeoman/adapter` seems to be required for typescript compatbility reasons. This is a bug coming either from yeoman or typescript that we haven't debugged yet.
