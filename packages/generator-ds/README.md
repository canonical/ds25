# Canonical Generator

## Getting Started

1. Install [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and this generator: `npm i -g yo @canonical/generator-ds`
2. Run the generator: `yo @canonical/ds`



### Available Generators
Generators are available for the following resources:
- [React Component](./src/component/README.md). 

## Caveats
- A recent refresh of the lockfile made the dependency `@yeoman/adapter` required. This is an unwanted side-effect of our lockfile update, and should try to be reverted in the future.
